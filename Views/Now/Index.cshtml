                    <p>‚òï I've officially launched my Minneapolis coffee locator app, <a href="https://mplscoffee.com">MPLS Coffee</a> in the iOS and Android stores. <a href="/blog/find-best-coffee-minneapolis">I'm continuing to work</a> on it as I get time, but that has not happened as much as I've wanted this month.
                    The main goal was to do a release every month, it's more like every other month right now. The next update will extend the range of coffee shops to include the entire state of Minnesota instead of just the Twin Cities metro area. That's probably going to require a name change sometime down the road.  </p>

                    <p>üñ•Ô∏è <a href="https://clintmcmahon.com">This website is now running .Net 8</a>! I migrated the blog posts to markdown format and updated the CSS to use Bootstrap 5. It's a pretty bland and boring design but I'd rather focus on creating software than updating my website design.  </p>

                    <p>ü§í There is something fierce going around Minneapolis these days. Everyone in my house has gotten ill in one way or another this month. We're on the tail end, I hope but everyone I talk to is going through the same thing. </p>

                    <p>üèÇ For the first time in 15 odd years I own a snowboard again. Now that Theo is learning to shred, I went out and bought my own board from Cal Surf in Uptown. Cal Surf is a Minneapolis institution for boards of snow and the street. They also have Nike Dunks, before buying my snowboard there I have not been there since the early 2000s. Now that I know they are a dunk shop, I'm going to shop there more often. </p>

                    <p>Building MPLS Coffee ‚Äì I‚Äôm working on a coffee shop locator app for Minneapolis and St. Paul, designed
                        for people who love a well-crafted cup of coffee. It‚Äôs called <a
                            href="https://mplscoffee.com">mplscoffee.com</a>, and it‚Äôs all about highlighting spots that offer
                        great roasts, quality pour-overs, and places worth visiting for their craft.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Reading About Strangers ‚Äì Since the pandemic and a lot of time spent working from home, I've been
                        reflecting on connection. I‚Äôm reading books focused on strangers and human connection, looking for ways
                        to better connect with people who aren‚Äôt like me. Working from CoCo has helped, but I‚Äôm interested in
                        more conversations that push my perspective.</p>

                    <p>Wrapping Up a Project for the State ‚Äì I'm putting the final touches on a significant project with the
                        State of Minnesota. It‚Äôs close to going live, and I‚Äôm excited to see it out in the world soon.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Meditating Daily ‚Äì I‚Äôm making it a priority to meditate for 10 minutes each day. The goal is to be more
                        mindful and reduce distraction, helping me be more present with people and projects.</p>

                    <p>Helping Theo Adjust ‚Äì My son Theo just started a new school. We‚Äôre working together to help him feel
                        comfortable, make new friends, and settle into the new schedule. Watching him step out of his comfort
                        zone has been a reminder of the value of persistence.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>Going to Tech Meetups ‚Äì I‚Äôm attending more meetups around the Twin Cities, connecting with the
                        local tech community. It‚Äôs been a good way to meet others and stay involved in
                        what‚Äôs going on.</p>

                        .NET 8 MVC for more flexibility and customization.</p>
