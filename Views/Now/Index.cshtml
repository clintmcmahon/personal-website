                        <p>‚òï <a href="/blog/mn-coffee-web">Minneapolis Coffee</a> has gone through a few changes and is now <a href="https://clintmcmahon.com/Blog/mpls-coffee-mn-coffee">MN Coffee</a>. The <a href="https://mplscoffee.com">website</a> and app now cover all the coffee shops in the state of Minnesota. So, if you are ever looking for a good coffee shop close by, I highly recommend downloading and using MN Coffee. </p>

                        <p>üìä Due to government cutbacks, I'm not doing any transplant research software development right now. The research group I'm working with has put a pause on all software & data visualization development for the time being. I'm still working on the <a href="https://transplantcentersearch.org" target="_blank">Transplant Center Search application</a> in various forms as we work our way through the next iteration of the application.</p>

                        <p>üñ•Ô∏è The majority of my consulting time is spent leading different software and architecture initiatives inside a large global law firm. This has been a long engagement but also a pretty good one. We're working with a lot of Angular, .NET Core WebAPI, and SQL Server‚Äîso pretty much working with the tech stack I want to be working with.</p>

                        <p>‚òï I've officially launched my Minneapolis coffee locator app, <a href="https://mplscoffee.com">MPLS Coffee</a>, in the iOS and Android stores. <a href="/blog/find-best-coffee-minneapolis">I'm continuing to work</a> on it as I get time, but that hasn't happened as much as I've wanted this month.
                        The main goal was to do a release every month‚Äîit's more like every other month right now. The next update will extend the range of coffee shops to include the entire state of Minnesota instead of just the Twin Cities metro area. That's probably going to require a name change sometime down the road.  </p>

                        <p>üñ•Ô∏è <a href="https://clintmcmahon.com">This website is now running .NET 8</a>! I migrated the blog posts to Markdown format and updated the CSS to use Bootstrap 5. It's a pretty bland and boring design, but I'd rather focus on creating software than updating my website design.  </p>

                        <p>ü§í There is something fierce going around Minneapolis these days. Everyone in my house has gotten ill in one way or another this month. We're on the tail end, I hope, but everyone I talk to is going through the same thing. </p>

                        <p>üèÇ For the first time in 15-odd years, I own a snowboard again. Now that Theo is learning to shred, I went out and bought my own board from Cal Surf in Uptown. Cal Surf is a Minneapolis institution for boards of snow and the street. They also have Nike Dunks‚Äîbefore buying my snowboard there, I hadn't been there since the early 2000s. Now that I know they're a Dunk shop, I'm going to shop there more often. </p>

                        <p>Building MPLS Coffee ‚Äì I'm working on a coffee shop locator app for Minneapolis and St. Paul, designed
                            for people who love a well-crafted cup of coffee. It's called <a
                                href="https://mplscoffee.com">mplscoffee.com</a>, and it's all about highlighting spots that offer
                            great roasts, quality pour-overs, and places worth visiting for their craft.</p>

                        <p>Reading About Strangers ‚Äì Since the pandemic and a lot of time spent working from home, I've been
                            reflecting on connection. I'm reading books focused on strangers and human connection, looking for ways
                            to better connect with people who aren't like me. Working from CoCo has helped, but I'm interested in
                            more conversations that push my perspective.</p>

                            mindful and reduce distraction, helping me be more present with people and projects.</p>

                            comfortable, make new friends, and settle into the new schedule. Watching him step out of his comfort
                            zone has been a reminder of the value of persistence.</p>

                        <p>Going to Tech Meetups ‚Äì I'm attending more meetups around the Twin Cities, connecting with the
                            local tech community. It's been a good way to meet others and stay involved in
                            what's going on.</p>
