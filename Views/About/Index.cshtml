                    Hi, I'm Clint, a software consultant from Minneapolis. I like to write about development, coffee and entrepreneurship. I care about building things that actually work and don't make people's lives more complicated than they already are.

                <p class="lead">
                    I've been writing code for over 20 years, mostly in .NET, Azure, and Umbraco. These days I help organizations untangle their technical messes-whether that's rescuing a legacy system that's held together with hope and duct tape, or building something new that won't collapse under pressure. I work with law firms, healthcare organizations, government and small businesses who need their technology to just work.

                    When I'm not building something with computers, I'm making espresso, running a small t-shirt company called <a href="https://biglittlecities.com">Big Little Cities</a> or hanging out with my lovely family.
