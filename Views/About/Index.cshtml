                    Hi, I'm Clint, a software consultant from Minneapolis. I like to write about development, coffee and entrepreneurship. I care about building things that actually work and don't make people's lives more complicated than they already are.

                    I've been writing code for over 20 years, mostly in .NET, Azure, and Umbraco. These days I help organizations untangle their technical messes—whether that's rescuing a legacy system that's held together with hope and duct tape, or building something new that won't collapse under pressure. I work with law firms, healthcare organizations, government and small businesses who need their technology to just work.
                </p>

                    When I'm not building something with computers, I'm making espresso, running a small t-shirt company called <a href="https://biglittlecities.com">Big Little Cities</a> or hanging out with my lovely family. 
                </p>
