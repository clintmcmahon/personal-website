                    I'm a Minneapolis-based software consultant with over two decades of experience building secure, scalable solutions across legal, healthcare, and public sector industries. My work focuses on helping organizations unlock the full potential of platforms like .NET, Azure, and Umbraco—whether that means rescuing a legacy codebase, building a new cloud-native application, or integrating systems that improve day-to-day operations.

                <p class="lead">
                    Outside of work, I like brewing coffee & making espresso drinks, snowboarding in the winter, and spending time with my wife, child, and our dog. 
                </p>
                <p class="lead">
                    I love meeting people and leading teams toward high-quality results. Whether it's helping a legal team streamline case workflows, designing secure portals for healthcare organizations, or elevating a local coffee shop's digital presence, I thrive on solving real-world problems with nice humans.
