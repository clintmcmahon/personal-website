                <p class="lead">Need someone who can actually build your .NET application? I write clean, maintainable code that works.</p>
                
                <p>I specialize in building web applications, APIs, and backend systems using ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, and modern .NET patterns. Whether you're starting from scratch or adding features to an existing application, I deliver code that's built to last.</p>
                
                <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">What I Build:</h4>
                <ul class="mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Web Applications:</strong> ASP.NET Core MVC, Razor Pages, Blazor</li>
                    <li><strong>APIs:</strong> RESTful services, GraphQL, microservices</li>
                    <li><strong>Backend Systems:</strong> Business logic, data access, integrations</li>
                    <li><strong>Cloud Solutions:</strong> Azure-native applications, serverless functions</li>
                    <li><strong>CMS Development:</strong> Umbraco, custom content management</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I work with teams who need a developer they can trust-someone who communicates clearly, delivers on time, and writes code that other developers won't hate.</p>

                <p class="lead">Need technical leadership without the overhead of a full-time hire? I step in as a senior developer or technical lead to guide your team.</p>
                
                <p>Sometimes you need more than just extra hands-you need someone who can make architectural decisions, mentor junior developers, and keep projects on track. I work alongside your team to provide technical direction and hands-on development.</p>
                
                <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">How I Help Teams:</h4>
                <ul class="mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Technical Leadership:</strong> Architecture decisions, code reviews, best practices</li>
                    <li><strong>Mentoring:</strong> Training junior developers, knowledge transfer</li>
                    <li><strong>Sprint Planning:</strong> Breaking down features, estimating work</li>
                    <li><strong>Code Quality:</strong> Establishing standards, improving workflows</li>
                    <li><strong>Problem Solving:</strong> Unblocking developers, debugging complex issues</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I integrate with your existing processes-whether that's Scrum, Kanban, or something else entirely. No ego, just results.</p>

                <p class="lead">Running an old .NET Framework application that needs to move forward? I help you modernize without rewriting everything.</p>
                
                <p>Legacy systems aren't going anywhere-but they don't have to hold you back. I specialize in incrementally modernizing old .NET applications, moving them to .NET Core/.NET 6+, updating dependencies, and refactoring code that's been causing problems.</p>
                
                <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">Modernization Services:</h4>
                <ul class="mb-4">
                    <li><strong>Framework Upgrades:</strong> .NET Framework to .NET Core/6+</li>
                    <li><strong>Dependency Updates:</strong> Replacing obsolete packages, updating libraries</li>
                    <li><strong>Code Refactoring:</strong> Improving structure without breaking functionality</li>
                    <li><strong>Database Migrations:</strong> Moving to modern ORM patterns, optimizing queries</li>
                    <li><strong>Cloud Migration:</strong> Moving from on-premises to Azure or AWS</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance Tuning:</strong> Making slow applications fast again</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I've modernized everything from 15-year-old WebForms apps to early MVC applications. The goal is always the same: get you on a modern platform without months of downtime.</p>

                <p class="lead">Project stalled? Developer disappeared? Code not working? I fix broken projects and get them back on track.</p>
                
                <p>Sometimes projects go sideways. The original developer leaves, deadlines get missed, or the code turns out to be unmaintainable. I step in, assess what's salvageable, and get things moving again.</p>
                
                <h4 class="mt-4 mb-3">How I Rescue Projects:</h4>

                </ul>

                <p>I've taken over projects in every state imaginable-from "mostly works" to "won't even compile." No judgment, just honest assessment and practical solutions.</p>
