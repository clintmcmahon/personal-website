<p>I&#8217;ve been working through <a href="https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/about/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brennan Dunn&#8217;s Double Your Freelancing</a> email course to level up on my technology consulting knowledge. This helps me learn what&#8217;s been successful for other consultants in the technology world so I can apply new things to my own business. One of the topics Brennan covers is for you to think about the first time you ever had to attach a price to yourself as a freelance developer. A big takeaway from the first couple lessons is don&#8217;t under price yourself as a freelance developer when pitching yourself to potential clients.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>I want you to think about the first time you ever had to attach a price to yourself as a freelance developer.</p><cite>&#8211; Brennan Dunn</cite></blockquote>

<p>There are two glaring instances that come to mind when I think about the first time I attached a price to myself as freelance developer. Both of those instances I set my freelance rate extremely low in order to win the projects.  Both times I failed &#8211;  either I didn&#8217;t get the project because my rate was so low or I did get the project but because I didn&#8217;t accurately scope the project the result was sub-par for the client.  Back when I was a green freelancer developer/consultant I would do anything to get those first portfolio pieces. But over the years I&#8217;ve learned a lot from those mistakes and now both my clients and I are better off because of what I learned from those mistakes.</p>

<h2 id="bad-product">Bad Product</h2>

<p>My first freelance web development project was a side project while still working as a full time developer. Landing the gig was a lot easier than I thought landing my first freelance gig would be. I set up a Twitter search query to return results for anyone looking for a developer near Minneapolis. You can do this using the <code>near</code> operator followed by your search term. For me this query looked like: near:minneapolis &#8220;looking for a developer&#8221;.  I responded to one of those tweets, met with the client, reviewed what needed to be done and threw out a price. I don&#8217;t remember much conversation but I was awarded the project right away. It was almost too easy.</p>

<p>The project was a simple CRUD application for a home goods supplier. Since I had no experience in the freelance market and I didn&#8217;t want to lose out on the job, I massively underbid the project. I think my bid was like $3,600 for what I&#8217;d quote today around $20,000. It was insane. I ended up working for free on a lot of the project and and ended up delivering a sub par product because of that. Since I massively underbid the project and was new to this world, I wasn&#8217;t comfortable doing the right thing &#8211; going back to the client to explain my shortsighted bid and to renegotiate the project cost. Instead, I worked fast and didn&#8217;t&#8217; deliver the exceptional product that I had promised the client. </p>

<h2 id="too-cheap">Too Cheap</h2>

<p>The other time I remember pricing myself so low was when I was asked to submit a bid to redesign a client&#8217;s website. During the proposal process they asked to see my portfolio of other projects I&#8217;d done. Since I was just starting as a freelance developer I didn&#8217;t have any paid client work to show off. All my development up until this point was confidential or internal to my previous full time jobs. Even though I didn&#8217;t have a portfolio to show, the client still met with me and asked that I submit a proposal. I thought this was a good time to undercut any competitors while creating a simple website design that I could start to use as a portfolio piece. The idea was to bid extremely low and work a little bit for free to get this portfolio piece. So I wouldn&#8217;t really be working for free as I&#8217;d be getting a portfolio piece in exchange for work done. Ah, kids&#8230;</p>

<p>I submitted my bid at $3,000 &#8211; I guess $3,000 was my benchmark in those days. Needless to say I did not get the job. But the kicker in this story is that a while later I got an email from the head of an agency who had also submitted a bid for the same project. In the email the person asked me &#8220;did you really bid that low on this project?&#8221;. Turns out that my bid was so low that the client brought this up to a competitor just to see if it was real.  They didn&#8217;t believe my bid was serious because it was so low, in fact it was a good $15,000 lower than the agency bid.  So you can be too cheap and it turns out a race to the bottom is not a race you want to be in.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>

<p>Fast forward to today, I now look back at what I did wrong and apply the knowledge I learned from these experiences to all projects I work on. Before any lines of code are written or any costs are submitted I sit down with the client to discuss the project in depth. I call this phase the discovery phase. During the discovery phase I will take deep dive into the reason why the client is hiring me in the first place. I want to understand the why and what behind the project: </p>

<ul><li>Why is this client looking to hire someone like me?</li><li>What problem are they trying to solve?</li><li>How can I help them achieve their goals?</li><li>What does a successful project look like?</li></ul>

<p>After we&#8217;ve answered the questions above, I should have a pretty good understanding of what needs to be done. The discovery phase allows me to get a good understanding of the problem so I can then be in a position to submit a well informed &#8211; and accurate &#8211; proposal. </p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the end I made a lot of mistakes when I started out as a freelance developer, but one of the biggest ones that hurt me the most was under pricing myself.  Not only did I not get jobs because I was so cheap, but I didn&#8217;t deliver the quality applications I pride myself in. </p>

<p>You see, most of the time our jobs as consultants shouldn&#8217;t be to just write code (sometimes that actually is the case) but the majority of the time it&#8217;s to help solve a problem or even uncover a problem. All of that comes down to helping clients be more successful in what they do. Today I spend a lot of time thinking about the client, determining what they <em>need</em> versus what they <em>want</em>, and listening to their problems and pain points before I even start thinking about hours and numbers. This has helped me not only become better at my job, but I&#8217;m consistently delivering more value to my clients. Which is the entire point anyway.</p>
