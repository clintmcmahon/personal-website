<p>Good morning. A few notes that I wanted to record for this lovely fall Friday. </p>

<ol>
<li>Near record warm has passed us and we&#8217;re back to normal cold fall. Should be great for saunaing.</li>

<li>Made a fantastic oat milk cortado this morning. Using regular <a href="https://www.oatly.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.oatly.com/">Oatly</a> blend, normally I use the Barista&#8217;s version, but today&#8217;s turned out fantastic. I&#8217;d say top five of all time home made cortados. </li>

<li>Driving T to school this morning he commented that so many people have black jackets. I replied saying they were a popular color. That brought up the question of what does &#8220;popular&#8221; mean. After I explained that it&#8217;s something that a lot of people like, for example Christmas, ice cream, soccer are all things that are popular because many people like them. When I asked him if he could think of something that was also popular, a few seconds passed and he replied &#8220;I know something that is popular for adults&#8221;. I asked what and he said &#8220;relaxing&#8221;. He got that right.</li>

<li>The <a href="https://armchairmediaexplorer.com">Armchair Media Explorer</a> has been slowly gaining traffic among the fans of the popular podcast Armchair Expert. People love it, but I really need someone with a large following to help promote it. So this morning I emailed Dax, Monica and their producer Rob in hopes that they read my emails. Having them Tweet (X?), Instagram it or just promote it would go a long ways for the platform.</li>

<li>Started a new project I&#8217;m calling the Radio Station Project. It&#8217;s going to contain a lot of radio station data and some nice data visualizations. More to come after I can collect some data.</li>
</ol>
