<p>It's going to be in the 80s this week which is ten degrees above normal for this time of year in Minnesota. I'm seeing a trend recently where September in Minneapolis just feels like an extension of August. I don't remember it always being this way, so I ran a <a href="https://xmacis.rcc-acis.org/" rel="noreferrer">ACIS query</a> to find out if this is a new trend or if it's been going on for a while. The query, visualization and data set below is for the average Minneapolis temperature (combination of high and low temps) for September from the beginning of records until today (2024).  </p><h2 id="minneapolis-september-mean-average-temperature-1873-2024">Minneapolis September Mean Average Temperature (1873-2024)</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-10-at-4.42.06-PM.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1209" height="703" srcset="/images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-10-at-4.42.06-PM.png 600w, /images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-10-at-4.42.06-PM.png 1000w, /images/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-10-at-4.42.06-PM.png 1209w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Minneapolis September Mean Average Temperature (1873-2024)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here are some observations I have that came out of this data:</p><ul><li>The warmest September on record occurred last year in <strong>2023</strong>.

Also highlighting that warm Septembers have occurred sporadically throughout the entire period of record. There were some bunching at the beginning of the century and then in the 1930s (the 1930s were exceptionally hot) then a "cool" period for a while until 2000 when things started to bunch and trend upwards. </p><p>Here are some other of my observations from looking at this data including the top 10 warmest Minneapolis Septembers on record. </p><p><strong>Top 10 Warmest Septembers In Minneapolis</strong>:</p><ol><li><strong>2023</strong>: 69.1°F</li><li><strong>1897</strong>: 68.8°F</li><li><strong>1931</strong>: 68.7°F</li><li><strong>1908</strong>: 68.0°F</li><li><strong>2015</strong>: 67.9°F</li><li><strong>1948</strong>: 67.9°F</li><li><strong>1891</strong>: 67.7°F</li><li><strong>2013</strong>: 67.2°F</li><li><strong>1936</strong>: 66.7°F</li><li><strong>2019</strong>: 66.7°F</li></ol><p><strong>Temperature Range</strong></p><ol><li>Lowest: 52.8°F (<strong>1965</strong>)</li><li>Highest: 69.1°F (<strong>2023</strong>)</li><li>Overall range: 16.3°F</li></ol><p><strong>Early Period vs. Recent Period</strong>:</p><ol><li>Average temp (1873-1900): 60.8°F</li><li>Average temp (1997-2024): 64.6°F</li><li>Difference: 3.8°F increase</li></ol><p><strong>Variability</strong>:</p><ol><li>The average temperature fluctuates significantly from year-to-year throughout the data.

The data strongly suggests a warming trend in Minneapolis' September temperatures over the past 151 years. This trend has accelerated in recent decades. However, significant year-to-year variability remains a consistent feature throughout the entire period.</p><p>This local trend follows with the broader global climate change observations from scientists around the world.
