Another local roaster, another disappointment. Sensing a theme here.

## Super Nova
**Silver Bird** · Mixed (Brazil, Ethiopian, Guatemalan) · ★★☆☆☆

*November 8, 2025*

| Brew Method | Grind Setting |
|-------------|---------------|
| Espresso | #13 |
| Pour Over | #20 |

Roast date 10-21-25.

Not great. Roast is dark with a little bitter.

Not sure I can get the bitter out with different pours.

A lot of hype in the local MPLS coffee community about these folks opening their own shop. Katie and I went last week and it was underwhelming.

Cold vibe. Not welcoming. Coffee took a while and it wasn't that good.

Big time disappointed. Espresso at shop similar to the not-great pulls and pours I got at home. Bummer—was looking forward to the new...

Two stars. I wanted to like Silver Bird. The Minneapolis coffee scene could use more good roasters. But between the dark roast, the bitter notes, and the underwhelming shop experience, this one's not making the rotation.
