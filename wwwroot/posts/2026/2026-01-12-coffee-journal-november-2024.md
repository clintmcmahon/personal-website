I only recorded one coffee this month, but it was a good one that I haven't seen from S.K. in a while. I remember when I bought this bag the barista told me it was a banger. He was right.

The #2 on espresso is misleading for this entry. Sometime in 2025 I recalibrated my Breville machine. If I did this coffee again the grind setting would be much higher.

## Kiambu
**S.K. Coffee** · Kenya · ★★★★★

*November 24, 2024*

**Grind:** #2 espresso · #20 pour over · **Water:** 205°F

Happy Thanksgiving!

Absolute banger. A real powerhouse coffee. It's good for espresso but a better coffee for pour overs. A bit on the sour side for pour over. Might be because I've been doing two espresso grind size. Might be too acidic for me and Katie. Both had heartburn.
