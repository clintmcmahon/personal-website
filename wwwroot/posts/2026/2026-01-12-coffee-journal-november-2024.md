Just one coffee this month, but it was a good one.

*November 24, 2024*

**Grind:** #2 espresso · #20 pour over · **Water:** 205°F

Happy Thanksgiving!

Absolute banger. A real powerhouse coffee. It's good for espresso but a better coffee for pour overs. A bit on the sour side for pour over. Might be because I've been doing two espresso grind size. Might be too acidic for me and Katie. Both had heartburn.

Three stars because of the acidity issue, but I'd try another S.K. Kenyan in a heartbeat. When it worked, it really worked.
