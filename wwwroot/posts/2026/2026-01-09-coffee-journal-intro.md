Back in 2024 my friend Jay got me a Field Notes journal pack to keep track of all the coffees I've been drinking. So over the past year and a half I've kept a handwritten coffee journal about every bag of coffee we've brewed at home. We use a Chemex for pour overs and Barista Pro espresso machine. 

Just about every bag of coffee that came through our kitchen got an entry: the roaster, origin, tasting notes, grind settings and my thoughts on how it came out.


## The Setup

My set up is a Chemex for pour overs and the mighty Barista Pro espresso machine. Generally during the week we do pour over and on the weekends we do espresso drinks. I use a Baratza Encore burr grinder and note the grind settings for each bag of coffee. There are usually dialing in that happens so I make a note of the grind settings I used and what the outcome of those settings were. This helps me narrow down what works with what type of roast.

## The Rating System

Each coffee gets a simple 1-5 star rating. These are how I feel about the roast or how much I enjoyed drinking it. A perfectly roasted, expertly sourced Ethiopian might get 2 stars if I couldn't figure out how to brew it without bitterness. Meanwhile, a straightforward Honduras that made Katie smile every morning gets 5 stars.

## The Roasters

Most of my coffee comes from a Verve Single Origin subscription. But I also explored local Minneapolis roasters like Dogwood, Spyhouse, Five Watt, S.K. Coffee and Minimum Wage Tim. There were some out of state roasters like Tandem that came through as well.

## What's Ahead

Over the next several posts, I'll share my monthly roundups of every coffee I brewed, what worked, what didn't, and the occasional tangent about cortados or cold brew experiments. If you're into home coffee brewing, I hope you find something useful. If nothing else, maybe you'll discover a roaster worth trying.

I'll come back to this post to update the list as I post the reviews later on. This will serve as a nice table of contents for the year.
