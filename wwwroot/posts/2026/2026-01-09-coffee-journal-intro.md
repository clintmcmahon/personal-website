For the past year and a half, I've kept a handwritten coffee journal in a Field Notes notebook. Every bag of coffee that came through our kitchen got an entry: the roaster, origin, tasting notes, grind settings, and my unfiltered thoughts on how it brewed.

It started in September 2024 when I realized I was burning through bags of coffee without really paying attention. I'd dial in a grind, make a few cups, and move on. The journal forced me to slow down and actually taste what I was drinking.

## The Setup

My daily drivers are a Chemex for pour over and an espresso machine for everything else. I use a Baratza Encore grinder, which means a lot of these entries include notes like "grind at 20 for pour over" or "too fine at 7, going coarser." If you're not familiar with grinder settings, just know that lower numbers mean finer grounds (for espresso) and higher numbers mean coarser (for pour over).

## The Rating System

Each coffee gets a simple 1-5 star rating. These aren't objective quality scores—they're how much I enjoyed drinking it. A perfectly roasted, expertly sourced Ethiopian might get 2 stars if I couldn't figure out how to brew it without bitterness. Meanwhile, a straightforward Honduras that made Katie smile every morning gets 5 stars.

Speaking of Katie: she appears throughout these entries as my unofficial barometer. She doesn't care about origin or process—she just knows if the coffee is good. When she downs a cup quickly, that's the real seal of approval.

## The Roasters

Most of my coffee comes from a Verve subscription, which explains why they dominate these entries. But I also explored local Minneapolis roasters (Dogwood, Spyhouse, Five Watt), discovered some favorites (S.K. Coffee, Minimum Wage Tin), and had a few disappointments along the way.

## What's Ahead

Over the next several posts, I'll share my monthly roundups—every coffee I brewed, what worked, what didn't, and the occasional tangent about cortados or cold brew experiments. If you're into home coffee brewing, I hope you find something useful. If nothing else, maybe you'll discover a roaster worth trying.
