The first coffee that I recorded at home was the <a href="https://www.vervecoffee.com/products/kerehaklu" target="_blank">Kerehaklu from Verve</a>. I only recorded one coffee from the month of September. In other months I've recorded more.

*September 17, 2024*

**Grind:** #3 espresso · #23 pour over · **Water:** 205°F

My first coffee journal entry. An Indian single origin from Verve. I don't normally brew coffees from this region, but that's kind of the point of a subscription isn't it? You get to try coffees from different places, hopefully some places you never would have thought to get coffee from. No detailed tasting notes on this one, just getting the system started.

Three stars feels right for a solid, unremarkable cup. Nothing wrong with it, nothing that made me sit up and take notice. A fine way to begin. I think that if I dialed in the grind settings more with water temperature I could really open this coffee up. I'm ranking this three stars based on my ability here, not so much the coffee.
