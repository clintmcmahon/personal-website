        This past fall I took a photograph class through Minneapolis Community Ed. The topic of the class was <i>The best photography locations in Minneapolis</i>. Our first session took place at the Scultpure Garden at the Walker Art Center in downtown Minneapolis. I liked the class a lot, it gave me a solid reason to go walk around the city and take photos. My usual problem is when I do get a free hour or two, I never know where to go take pictures. So, it was nice to have a set schedule for a month that told me exactly where to show up and start taking some pics.

        Here are some of those photos I took that night.
