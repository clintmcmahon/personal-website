<p>Sometimes I find myself mindlessly scrolling through my phone after completing a task, even though there&#8217;s nothing in particular that I&#8217;m looking for. I just default go for my phone. It&#8217;s a strange feeling, almost like an automatic reaction that you can&#8217;t seem to control. You may not even know what you&#8217;re looking for, but your brain just craves that stimulation that comes with scrolling through apps and feeds.</p>

<p>But lately, I&#8217;ve started to become more aware of this habit and have been making an effort to break away from it. Whenever I catch myself going for my phone after finishing a hard task or bit of code, I put the phone down and take a moment to pause and think. If I haven&#8217;t done a ten minute meditation yet then this is a good time for one, or perhaps I&#8217;ll jot down some notes in a journal to clear my head and focus on the task at hand &#8211; just as I&#8217;m doing right now.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve noticed that when I get in front of the urge to reach for my phone and instead take a beat to be present, I can actually feel my brain working and rewiring itself.</p>

<p>I often find myself taking quick breaks between tasks to check Hacker News or other tech sites. But I&#8217;ve come to realize that I can take advantage of these breaks and be much more constructive with them. Instead of mindlessly scrolling through headlines and skimming articles, I can write something or go for a walk. A lot of good ideas come to me on my daily walks. This not only gives my brain a break, but it also allows me stay focused on the things that help me get to where I want to go.</p>

<p>Breaking free from the habit of mindless scrolling and using breaks mindfully has had a huge impact on my productivity and overall day-to-day. I highly recommend trying to catch yourself if you find that you&#8217;re reaching for your phone throughout the day. I wrote this blog post during one of those times, which seems like a good enough time as any to write some blog posts.</p>
