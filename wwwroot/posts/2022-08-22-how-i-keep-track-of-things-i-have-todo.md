<p>This is a post about how I keep track of things I have to do. I&#8217;ve tried special note taking strategies people on Hacker News swear by as well as productivity apps. But nothing has been as successful as using a pen and paper to keep a TODO list in my notebook. There are so many ways to keep track of all the different things that I need to get done &#8211; in code I write //TODO comments, in projects I use GitHub issues and Trello. </p>

<p>My process is very basic. Every morning I sit down at my desk and write the date in the upper right corner of a page (if the previous day&#8217;s list was short I&#8217;ll draw a line below that day&#8217;s list and start right below it) in my notebook. Then I write a bullet list of all the things that I need to get done that day. Sometimes each tasks is separated by topic or other times I just write one giant list of the different things I need to get done that day. </p>

<p>Topics are pretty free range, work TODOs are usually the name of a project or client  and anything that falls outside of work gets listed under the Personal heading. This method seems to fit my work/life style the best. Like I said, I&#8217;ve tried more complex task taking styles but none of them ever really fit. Here&#8217;s a list of things that I&#8217;ve tried to use to keep track of the things I need to do, but nothing compares to the classic just writing down the tasks on a sheet of paper.</p>

<ul><li>Simple text file that I had saved in Dropbox so each of my devices could read and write to the file. This way I could have a single text file that allowed me to update from anywhere. From PC, Mac or iPhone I could always pull up the TODOs and edit them right there.</li><li>Apple Reminders app &#8211; for some reason I could never stick with this method. And I ended up with far too many different reminder categories than I actually needed</li><li>Apple Notes app &#8211; A highly useful piece of software, but I never remember to use it. I&#8217;ll go through spurts where I&#8217;ll try to use it for everything and think it&#8217;s the greatest thing in the world, only to completely forget about soon after.</li><li><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27513008" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27513008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Various</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25561398" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25561398" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">methods</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23844490" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23844490" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from</a> the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29789293" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29789293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hacker News community</a>. </li></ul>

<p>In the end the best thing that works for me is to make an entry in my notebook every morning when I sit down at my desk. My mind is fresh and before I dive into any emails/code/Slack messages I can really think about what I&#8217;m going to accomplish that day. This helps prepare for the day as well as remember what tasks are still outstanding from the previous day so I can copy them over to the new day. </p>

<p>Throughout the day as new tasks come up I&#8217;ll write them down in my notebook. Having these notes right in front of me really helps when I get into that state of feeling lost or if I&#8217;m not sure what I should be working on next. I just reference my notes that are right in front of me and I&#8217;m back on track.</p>

<p>Throughout the day as I finish a TODO task I cross out the item with a straight line through the text. Not only is this weirdly satisfying, but I can go back through my notebook and look at how many things I was able to get done over the weeks/months/years. It&#8217;s also a fun to take a notebook from two years ago and see what different things I was working on or what my priorities were back in 2020. </p>

<p>In summary, here is my method of keeping track of all the things I need to get done during the day:</p>

<ul><li>Every morning I sit down at my desk and open my notebook. I write the date in the upper right hand corner of a new page</li><li>Create a heading that&#8217;s a topic/project/client and underline the text</li><li>Start each new tasks with a + sign or little square box. Think about what tasks I need to get done and write them out under the appropriate topic heading</li><li>Carry over any previous day&#8217;s items that I didn&#8217;t get completed below the appropriate heading</li><li>Go through emails and add to the list as new tasks come up</li><li>Work through the tasks and cross them off the list when they&#8217;re complete</li><li>As new things pop up during the day or I remember things that need to get done, I just write them in the appropriate spot in my notebook.</li></ul>
