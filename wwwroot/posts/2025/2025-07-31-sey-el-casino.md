**Sey Coffee** · NYC · Pink Bourbon, Colombia · ★★★★☆

<!-- IMAGE: el-casino.png -->

**Grind:** max coarse cold brew (Baratza Encore) · **Water:** room temp (cold brew)

Red fruit, lemon zest, fresh blueberry.

Highest grind on my Baratza Encore. Proper 5oz into 32oz jar of water. Let sit for 16 hours.

Absolute banger of a cold brew. Sey does a lot of fruity coffees for me, they make really good cold brew. Not getting the lemon taste, but definitely the blueberry.

Wonder if my taste buds will evolve? Or have they diminished with time? Stopped cutting the concentrate as it was taking the taste away and found I really like the taste of full power though my body can't handle all that power. Shaketown USA.

Adding ice also helps tone down the caffeine power. But I could drink this coffee all day. Another problem? With at-home cold brew is we cook a whole bag in a couple days.

Four stars, but honestly could be five. The best cold brew of the year so far. Sey knows what they're doing.
