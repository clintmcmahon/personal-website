**Tandem Roasters** · Portland, Maine · ★★★★☆

<!-- IMAGE: west-end-blues.png -->

**Grind:** #8-9 espresso · **Water:** 205°F

Traditional Espresso. Blueberry hill, sugarfoot stomp, Herbie Srebles.

Great espresso. Comes out bold and smooth. Maybe a little too much. There are some fruit notes and don't love. This is my second bag, the first I absolutely loved.

Switched to primarily espresso recently. Feeling like milk has been leaving me feel bloated. I miss cortados but figuring out eating is top priority.

Drinking this after two weeks after the roast date. Roaster once told me this was the sweet spot.

Refactored the machine for a new grind size. Setting 9 returns at 30 sec. Dropping to 8 extended pull to 37 sec.

Four stars. Set this as a monthly subscription.
