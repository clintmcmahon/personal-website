**Grind:** #7 espresso (too watery) · #18-19 pour over (22g dose) · **Water:** 205°F

Roasted April 15. Green apples, plum, butterscotch. Golden plum. Roast 2-4.

Still waiting for right grind size. Espresso at 7 was too watery. But still very good.

Pour over 22g at 18-19 turned out well. Total pour time was just under the four minute mark.

Five stars. Even when the espresso ran a little thin, the flavor was there. A nice bright fruit, butterscotch sweetness, clean finish. The pour overs were outstanding. This might be my favorite Verve coffee so far.
