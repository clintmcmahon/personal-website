Shopify’s app store is full of solutions, but sometimes you don’t want another monthly fee—or the bloat that comes with it. Here’s how I help clients build custom Shopify features using code, not apps.
</p>

<h2>Why Go App-Free?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lower costs (no recurring fees)</li>
<li>Better performance (less code bloat)</li>
<li>Full control over your store’s features</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples of Custom Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Custom product badges or labels using Liquid</li>
<li>Advanced metafield displays (e.g., ingredient lists, care instructions)</li>
<li>Unique collection sorting or filtering</li>
<li>Custom cart logic (e.g., free gift with purchase)</li>
</ul>

<h2>How I Build Them</h2>
<p>
I use Shopify’s built-in Liquid templating, metafields, and theme customizations. No app required. If you want to avoid app bloat and keep your store lean, <a href="/contact">let’s talk</a> about custom development.
