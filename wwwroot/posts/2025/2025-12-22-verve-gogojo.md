**Verve** · Ethiopian - Washed - Heirloom · ★★★☆☆

<!-- IMAGE: gogojo.png -->

**Grind:** #26 pour over · **Water:** 198°F (lower for Ethiopian)

East African. Peach, jasmine, simple syrup.

Been working on this for a week or two. Used ChatGPT for help brewing the east African.

I went up to 26 grind and 198° Came out smooth finally. Up until now it was bitter. Can't taste the notes but the taste was smooth.

Customers knocked down theirs in record speed. They're my barometer for how good a coffee is. Usually too kind to tell me when a coffee stinks.

Grind at 26 for pour over. Temp was 198°, too cool to bring out flavor, hotter temps bring out blunt notes. Start next African light at 205°.

Three stars. Finally cracked the Ethiopian code by grinding coarser with lower temp. It only took me a year and an AI assistant. Getting my customers approval was the real validation.
