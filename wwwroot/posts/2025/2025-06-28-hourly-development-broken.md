Hourly billing is the default for most software development—but it’s broken. Here’s why I moved away from hourly rates, and what I offer instead.
</p>

<h2>Why Hourly Fails</h2>
<ul>
<li>Incentivizes more hours, not better results</li>
<li>Makes budgeting unpredictable for clients</li>
<li>Penalizes efficiency and expertise</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Works Better: Value-Based Pricing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Aligns incentives—everyone wants the project done right, not just done</li>
<li>Clear deliverables and outcomes</li>
<li>Predictable costs for clients</li>
</ul>
