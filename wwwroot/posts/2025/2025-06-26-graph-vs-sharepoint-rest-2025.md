<p>
Choosing between Microsoft Graph and the SharePoint REST API isn’t always obvious. I’ve helped clients with both, and here’s how I help them decide which is right for their project in 2025.
</p>

<h2>Microsoft Graph: Pros & Cons</h2>
<ul>
<li>Unified API for all Microsoft 365 services</li>
<li>Modern authentication and SDKs</li>
<li>Some SharePoint features still missing or limited</li>
</ul>

<h2>SharePoint REST API: Pros & Cons</h2>
<ul>
<li>Full access to legacy SharePoint features</li>
<li>Can be more complex to authenticate and use</li>
<li>May be deprecated in the future</li>
</ul>

<h2>How I Help Clients Pick</h2>
<p>
I look at the features you need, your existing stack, and long-term support. For most new projects, Graph is the way forward—but not always.
