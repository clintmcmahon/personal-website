**Dogwood Coffee** · ★★★☆☆

<!-- IMAGE: mixed-tape.png -->

**Grind:** #3-4 espresso · #20 pour over · **Water:** 205°F

Chocolate & caramely.

Brewed for both espresso and Chemex. First batch of pour over at 18-19 grind on 22g beans came out really well—people loved it. Later pours were more middle of the road. Consistency was the challenge here.

This is a solid coffee but I'm realizing my palate is shifting toward single origins and lighter roasts. I've been exploring more out-of-state roasters through subscriptions, which has opened up what I'm looking for. Dogwood's single origin offerings are probably more my speed these days.

Three stars. Good local option, just not matching where my taste is going right now.
