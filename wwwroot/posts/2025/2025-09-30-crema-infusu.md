**Crema** · Southern Italy Style · ★★★☆☆

<!-- IMAGE: infusu.png -->

**Grind:** #12-13 espresso · #20 pour over · **Water:** 205°F

Southern Italy espresso. Dark roast.

Too dark for pour over and regular espresso.

Really solid in latte and cortado. The dark roast makes for full rich chocolatey espresso drinks.

It's too dark for a smooth espresso for me. I think if you are into that Italian style of espresso this will be your jam.

4 stars with milk, 3 stars on its own.

Three stars overall. This is exactly what it says it is: a dark, Italian-style espresso roast. I don't usually go this dark, but it made excellent milk drinks.
