**B.K. Coffee** · Colombian · ★★★☆☆

<!-- IMAGE: mantos-juntas.png -->

**Grind:** #12 espresso · #20 pour over · **Water:** 205°F

Natural process. Valle D Cauca. Mantas Juntes Micromill.

Chocolate, kumquat, blackberry.

Got pour overs and a few espressos.

Espresso was straight ok, too much fruit forwardness for me.

Pour overs have been solid. Very fruit forward.
