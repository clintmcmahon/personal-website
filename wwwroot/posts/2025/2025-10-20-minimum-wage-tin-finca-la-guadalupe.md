**Minimum Wage Tim** · Honduras · ★★★☆☆

<!-- IMAGE: finca-la-guadalupe.png -->

**Grind:** #18 pour over · **Water:** 205°F

Roasted on 10-8-25.

Tried on Monday morning. It's good. Solid but not blow you away. Could be my brew method. Ground coarse because the beans are huge. Usually this beans mean longer extraction.

Draw down was ~4 minutes. My customers gave it a "good". We can do better.

Working between 20-22 grind size, this makes an ok cup. Still a little bitter. Not sure I will go back to this again.

Didn't try espresso.

Three stars.
