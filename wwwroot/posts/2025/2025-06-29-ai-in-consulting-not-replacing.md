AI is everywhere, and yes—I use it in my consulting work. But I’m not automating myself out of a job. Here’s how I use AI to help clients, and why the human element still matters.

<h2>How AI Helps</h2>
<ul>
<li>Speeds up research and code generation</li>
<li>Automates repetitive tasks</li>
<li>Surfaces insights from data faster</li>
</ul>

<h2>What AI Can’t Do</h2>
<ul>
<li>Understand business context</li>
<li>Build trust with stakeholders</li>
<li>Make judgment calls on tradeoffs</li>
</ul>
