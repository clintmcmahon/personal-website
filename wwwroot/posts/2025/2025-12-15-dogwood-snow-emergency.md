**Dogwood** · ★★★☆☆

<!-- IMAGE: snow-emergency.png -->

**Grind:** #20-22 pour over · **Water:** 205°F

Roasted on 11-25-25.

I <i>think</i> this used to be the house blend for the Askov Finlayson kids. It was the coffee was better there than I am able to brew.

Working between 20-22 grind size, this makes an ok cup. Still a little bitter. 

Didn't try espresso.

Three stars. Snow Emergency used to hit different when I'd get it at a café. Brewing at home, I couldn't capture that magic but working on it.
