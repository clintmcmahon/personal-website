    <p>
       I didn't take very many photos this month, outside of all the ones I took over <a href="/blog/southern-california-vacation">spring break in southern California</a>. Here are four(!!) that I took over the month of April. April is a transition month in Minneapolis (and all of Minnesota) where everything is brown and it's hard to find any good color.
