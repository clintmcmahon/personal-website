When I’m called in to rescue a .NET project, I don’t wing it—I use a repeatable checklist. Here’s the framework I follow to quickly assess, triage, and stabilize any .NET codebase. Feel free to use it, or <a href="/contact">hire me to run the audit for you</a>.
</p>

<h2>My .NET Rescue Checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Build & Run:</strong> Can you build and run the app locally? Document any blockers.</li>
<li><strong>Source Control:</strong> Is the code in version control? Are there uncommitted changes?</li>
<li><strong>Dependencies:</strong> List all third-party packages. Are any out of date or unsupported?</li>
<li><strong>Secrets & Config:</strong> Check for hardcoded secrets, config files, and environment variables.</li>
<li><strong>Tests:</strong> Are there automated tests? Do they pass?</li>
<li><strong>Security:</strong> Look for obvious vulnerabilities (open ports, outdated libraries, etc).</li>
<li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Is there a README? Deployment instructions?</li>
<li><strong>Stakeholder Pain Points:</strong> What’s broken, what’s urgent, what’s nice-to-have?</li>
</ol>

<h2>What’s Next?</h2>
<p>
Once you’ve run the checklist, prioritize fixes that unblock the team and stabilize the app. If you want a full audit and rescue plan, <a href="/contact">let’s talk</a>.
