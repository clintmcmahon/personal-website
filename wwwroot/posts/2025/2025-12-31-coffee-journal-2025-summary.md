![Coffee journal Field Notes notebook](/images/2025/coffee-journal-cover.jpg)

From September 2024 to December 2025, I logged every bag of coffee that came through our kitchen in a Field Notes notebook. Here's what I learned.

## By the Numbers

- **26 bags** of coffee
- **13 roasters** tried
- **Average rating**: 2.9 stars
- **5-star coffees**: 2
- **1-star moments**: 2

## The Five-Star Coffees

Only two bags earned the full five stars:

### Manuel Vallecillo (Verve, Honduras)
*March 2025*

"Straight five stars. Smooth and chocolatey." The first coffee that made me understand what I was chasing. Perfect for cortados, perfect for straight espresso, perfect for mornings when you just want something good.

### Montes De Oro (Verve, Costa Rica)
*April 2025*

Green apples, plum, butterscotch. The pour overs were outstanding—clean, bright, balanced. Back-to-back five-star months from Verve.

## Honorable Mentions

**El Casino (Sey, Colombia)** - The best cold brew of the year. Pink bourbon processed as cold brew concentrate was a revelation.

**Mustefa Abakeno (Verve, East African)** - Made excellent cold brew for teacher appreciation week. Light, fruity, refreshing.

## The Disappointments

**Chelchele (Verve, Ethiopia)** - My first one-star. Couldn't figure out the grind, every cup was bitter. It took me over a year to learn that Ethiopian beans need coarser grinds and lower temps.

**Five Watt Cortado** - Worst cortado of 2025. Burned, bitter, over-foamed. The people-watching was more interesting than the drink.

## Roaster Rankings

**Would order again:**
1. Verve (subscription continues)
2. S.K. Coffee (excellent Kenyans and Guatemalans)
3. Minimum Wage Tin (consistent, reliable)
4. Sey (for cold brew specifically)

**Emergency backup:**
- Dogwood (fine but not exciting)

**Not reordering:**
- Silver Bird
- B.K. Coffee
- Huckleberry
- Never Coffee

## Minneapolis Coffee Take

This journal confirmed something I suspected: Minneapolis roasters are falling behind. Too many dark roasts, too many underwhelming café experiences. There are exceptional roasters elsewhere shipping fresh beans for the same price. Until local spots step up, my subscription stays with Verve.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Ethiopian beans need coarser grinds** - Took me a year to figure this out. Grind at 26, temp at 198°.

2. **Katie is the barometer** - If she downs her cup quickly, the coffee is good. If it sits, something's off.

3. **Cold brew concentrate shouldn't be diluted** - Cutting it with water was taking the flavor away.

4. **Clean the machine** - Half my espresso problems were solved by a good cleaning, not a grind adjustment.

5. **Two weeks post-roast is the sweet spot** - A roaster told me this and they were right.

## What's Next

I'm starting a new notebook for 2026. The format works—quick entries, honest reactions, grind settings for reference. Maybe I'll finally nail those East African light roasts on the first try.

Thanks for following along. If you made it this far, you probably care about coffee as much as I do. Here's to better cups in the new year.
