I’m excited to share a new addition to the website: the <a href="/feeds">feeds page</a>. This new section is dedicated to highlighting the blogs and writers I follow and built for a stronger sense of community on the indie web.

The feeds page is my curated list of RSS feeds from blogs and other sites that I enjoy and inspire me. Each entry includes a link to the blog and its RSS feed, making it easy for anyone to discover new blogs and add them to their own feed reader. You can find it at [my /feeds page](/feeds).

I can't remember where I last read about a dedicated feeds page. But it's really not different than blog roll. Having a feeds page has been in the back of my mind for a while. I've been slowely building up my own private RSS feeds in Feedly for years. This page exists because I love the web as a network of individuals sharing ideas, stories and expertise in whatever realm they have success in. The indie web thrives on small blogs talking to each other, linking out, and building relationships across sites. Unlike the walled gardens of social media - not to mention the unreal amount of ads there, this approach puts control back in the hands of creators and readers alike.

By sharing the blogs I read, I hope to showcase some other good blogs for people to read as well. That and to allow others to explore and connect with the folks on the indie web. 

In a way the web is started to go back to its roots with more and more people creating their own websites. Ditching social media and taking control back. I see this kind of open, interconnected community as the future of the web. As more people rediscover the joy of personal blogging and RSS, the next version of the web should be more human, more creative and more resilient. If you’re looking for some really great blogs to follow or want to grow your own reading list, check out the <a href="/feeds">/feeds page</a> and create your own on your website.
