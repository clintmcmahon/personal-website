**Verve** · East African · ★★★★☆

**Grind:** max coarse cold brew · **Water:** room temp (cold brew)

Light roast. Roast level 2-4. Pear, marmalade, pine.

Only grinded on max coarse for cold brew. Really good stuff. Did 32oz water with 6oz of coarse beans then doubled the water after. Pretty standard cold brew method.

One of the best cold brews I've made in some time. The best was the Dogwood Rwandan roast I recently brewed that for my kiddo's school for teacher appreciation week. Surprisingly nobody told me how great it was.

Four stars. Light, fruity, refreshing andexactly what you want from a cold brew as the weather warms up. The pear notes really came through cold.
