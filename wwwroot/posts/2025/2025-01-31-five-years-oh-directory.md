        This morning I opened the <a href="https://ooh.directory">ooh.directory</a> and saw my blog was highlighted for being five years old today. I've been writing about <a href="/blog/fizzbuzz-in-c">random tech bits</a> for the last five years and didn't even realize it. The ooh directory was nice enough to remind me of that. This directory is the yellow pages or virtual index for blogs on the Internet that I use to find other blogs to read. The majority of my RSS is based on blogs I've found through this site - that and from <a href="https://kevquirk.com/">Kev Quirk's blog roll</a>. I think the majority of the blogs in the ooh directory started from Hacker News, but it's grown since it's initial launch all those years ago. The site is run by <a href="https://www.gyford.com/">Phil Gyford</a> and is a really great resource for finding different blogs to read.

        Big ups to Phil for creating and running this site. I've been a big fan since 2022 when it was first launched on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33719983">Hacker News</a>. This little recognition has been a good motivator to write more. Here's to hoping it sticks.
