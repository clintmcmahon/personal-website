**Huckleberry + Never Coffee**  
**Blue Orchid & Boomerang** · ★★☆☆☆

Combining these two because they taught me the same thing about my preferences. Both roasters have strong followings—Blue Orchid especially gets a lot of love on Reddit. So I went in with high expectations.

Both run darker than what I've been gravitating toward. The beans are bigger than most of what I brew, which threw off my grind calibration. I tried adjusting but couldn't find the sweet spot with my setup.

This isn't a quality issue—both roasters are well-regarded for good reason. This is me learning that I prefer lighter roasts that bring out origin characteristics over bold, dark roast profiles. Different strokes.

Two stars for my experience, but if you're into darker, more traditional roasts, these might be exactly what you're looking for. Just not where my palate is right now.
