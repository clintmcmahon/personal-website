Taking over an abandoned project is tricky—there’s history, politics, and usually a lot of technical debt. Here’s how I step in, calm the chaos, and get things moving again (without burning bridges).
</p>

<h2>My Approach</h2>
<ul>
<li>Listen first—understand what happened and why</li>
<li>Stabilize the project before making big changes</li>
<li>Communicate clearly with all stakeholders</li>
<li>Document everything (for the next person, too)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Common Pitfalls</h2>
<ul>
<li>Blaming previous teams (don’t do it)</li>
<li>Trying to rewrite everything at once</li>
<li>Ignoring business context</li>
</ul>
