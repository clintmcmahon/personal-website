**S.K. Coffee** · Huehuetenango · ★★★☆☆

<!-- IMAGE: sk-guatemala.png -->

**Grind:** #4 espresso · #19-20 pour over · **Water:** 205°F

This is a tricky one. Pour overs are really good. But espresso I could do without. Can't get the grind-pull to come out smooth for espresso. A lot of shakes and splashes.

Pour over is coming out good. A little fast at 21. Going down to 20 then...

Three stars. The pour overs were genuinely good & clean, balanced, easy to drink. But I couldn't crack the espresso code. Every pull came out sputtering and uneven. Sometimes you just have to accept that a coffee wants to be brewed one way.
