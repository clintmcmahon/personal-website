**Verve** · East African · ★★★★☆

**Grind:** #10 cold brew · **Water:** room temp (cold brew)

Blood orange, black tea, raspberry leaf.

Grinded only for cold brew. 10 grind for cold brew. 32oz twice for first test. 32oz the second.

Didn't cut with any water out of the soak. Prefer the taste when I don't dilute the concentrate. First batch turned out nicely. Will keep making cold brew with this roast down the road.

This was the roast that saved me from cancelling my Verve subscription. Not because of bad coffee, but because of too many African blends that I suck at brewing. Still don't lean towards that sweet tangy fruit coffees.

Four stars. When I stopped diluting the concentrate, everything clicked. Bold, clean, and just the right amount of fruit without going overboard.
