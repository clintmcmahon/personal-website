Shopify store running slow? You’re not alone. Most advice says “install an optimizer app,” but that’s rarely the real fix. Here’s how I help clients speed up their Shopify sites—no extra apps required.
</p>

<h2>Common Shopify Performance Killers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Theme Bloat:</strong> Too many unused sections, scripts, or CSS files.</li>
<li><strong>Liquid Loops:</strong> Inefficient loops and filters can slow down page rendering.</li>
<li><strong>Metafield Overuse:</strong> Storing too much data in metafields can drag down performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Fix It</h2>
<ul>
<li>Audit your theme—remove unused code and apps.</li>
<li>Refactor Liquid templates for efficiency.</li>
<li>Limit metafield use to what’s truly needed.</li>
<li>Compress images and use Shopify’s built-in CDN.</li>
</ul>
