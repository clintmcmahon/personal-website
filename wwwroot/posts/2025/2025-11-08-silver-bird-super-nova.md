<!-- IMAGE: super-nova.png -->

**Grind:** #13 espresso · #20 pour over · **Water:** 205°F

Roast date 10-21-25.

This blend runs darker than what I usually brew. Tried a few different grind settings but kept getting some bitter notes I couldn't dial out. Might be my technique, might be the roast profile. Hard to say.

Tried it at their shop first, which is how I ended up buying a bag. The in-shop experience was quieter than I expected—more focused on the coffee than conversation. Their espresso had that same darker profile I got at home, so at least I was consistent.

Two stars. This one's on the edge of too dark for my current preferences. I'm learning I lean more toward lighter roasts these days, especially for pour over. If you like a bold, darker espresso blend, this might work better for you than it did for me.
