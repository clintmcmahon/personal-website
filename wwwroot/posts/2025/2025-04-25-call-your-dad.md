For my Dad's birthday I got a notification on my iPhone home screen that said "Call Dad. Birthday found in contacts". I've never seen this feature before for anyone else in my contacts, so I don't know how long it's been there for. But I'm a huge fan of it. 

In comparison to other AI things I've tried this week, this is by far the most successfull and useful to me. I tried asking ChatGPT to write a new <a href="https://todaysrecordhigh.com">Today's Record High</a> for me but gave up out of pure frustration. When making updates to the controllers the AI kept changing variable names and updating the model to a different model on each prompt. I got so annoyed I stopped building the new version all together.

Normally, I don't like AI being forced on me. I like to use it when I specifically ask for AI to be involved in my life. But this call your dad reminder was really great. I didn't ask Siri to tell me that it was his birthday, but I sure do appreciate it. I always worry that I'm going to forget to call my parents on their birthdays, but everytime I look at my phone today I am going to see this reminder until I swipe it off the screen. 

Thank you, Siri.
