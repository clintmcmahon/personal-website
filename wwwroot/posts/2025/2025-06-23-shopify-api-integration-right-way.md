Shopify API integrations can be a nightmare when they’re flaky or half-baked. I’ve fixed more than a few. Here’s what I’ve learned about building integrations that last—and how to debug the ones that don’t.
</p>

<h2>Common Integration Pitfalls</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ignoring API rate limits</li>
<li>Poor error handling (silent failures, missing retries)</li>
<li>Not using webhooks for real-time updates</li>
<li>Hardcoded credentials or endpoints</li>
</ul>

<h2>How I Build Reliable Integrations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Respect Shopify’s API limits and use backoff strategies</li>
<li>Implement robust error logging and alerting</li>
<li>Use webhooks for sync, not just polling</li>
<li>Securely store and rotate credentials</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bonus: Debugging a Broken Integration</h2>
<p>
Check logs, inspect API responses, and test with real data. Sometimes a single missing field or a silent 429 error is the culprit.
