Cold brew season is here, and this East African was ready for it.

## Mustefa Abakeno
**Verve** · East African · ★★★★☆

*May 11, 2025*

| Brew Method | Grind Setting |
|-------------|---------------|
| Cold Brew | Max coarse |

Light roast. Roast level 2-4. Pear, marmalade, pine.

Only grinded on max coarse for cold brew. Really good stuff. Did 32oz water with 6oz of coarse beans then doubled the water after. Pretty standard cold brew method.

One of the best cold brews I've made in some time. The best was the Dogwood Rwandan roast I recently brewed that for Theo's school for teacher appreciation week. Surprisingly nobody told me how great it was.

Four stars. Light, fruity, refreshing—exactly what you want from a cold brew as the weather warms up. The pear notes really came through cold.
