If you’ve ever deployed an app to Azure and watched it crawl, you’re not alone. I’ve helped clients untangle slow Azure apps more times than I can count. Here’s what I look for when troubleshooting performance issues—and how you can fix them.
</p>

<h2>Common Azure Performance Killers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bad Configuration:</strong> Wrong app service plan, missing scaling rules, or misconfigured connection strings can tank performance.</li>
<li><strong>Cold Starts:</strong> Serverless functions and web apps can be slow to spin up if they’re not kept warm.</li>
<li><strong>Noisy Neighbors:</strong> Shared resources mean someone else’s workload can impact yours.</li>
<li><strong>Unoptimized Database Calls:</strong> N+1 queries, missing indexes, or chatty APIs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How I Diagnose the Root Cause</h2>
<p>
Start with Azure Monitor and Application Insights. Look for spikes, slow dependencies, and error rates. Don’t just guess—let the data guide you.
</p>

<h2>Quick Wins</h2>
<ul>
<li>Right-size your app service plan</li>
<li>Enable autoscale</li>
<li>Warm up serverless endpoints</li>
<li>Optimize database queries</li>
<li>Review network latency and region placement</li>
</ul>
