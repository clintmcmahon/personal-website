<p>Managing consulting clients effectively requires a balance of professionalism, clear communication, and the ability to deliver value consistently. Here are best practices to help build strong client relationships and maintain a successful consulting business:</p>

<h2>Set Clear Expectations from the Start</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Define the Scope of Work (SOW): Draft a detailed SOW or proposal outlining deliverables, timelines, responsibilities, and boundaries. This prevents scope creep and misaligned expectations.</li>
    <li>Agree on Communication Norms: Specify preferred communication channels (email, Slack, etc.), response times, and meeting schedules.</li>
    <li>Clarify Roles and Responsibilities: Ensure both you and the client understand who is accountable for specific aspects of the project.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Define the Scope of Work</h2>
<p>
    Once you know the problem and the desired outcome, define the scope of work. This clarity helps set expectations appropriately from the beginning. Having a well-documented scope gives everyone involved a clear picture of what success looks like.
</p>

<h2>Prepare Technical Requirements</h2>
<p>
    If there are specific technical requirements, have those ready before engaging a consultant. For example, does your business mandate the use of a particular tech stack? If you’re unsure, it’s okay to let the consultant recommend their preferred tools. Remember, many businesses struggle to integrate technology effectively if they’re not ready to support the solution long-term.
</p>

<h2>Look for Relevant Experience</h2>
<p>
    Finding developers and consultants who have experience in your industry or technology stack will make the onboarding process a lot easier. They will be able to get up to speed faster, but there's the added benefit of knowing they are already comfortable working in your domain and/or with your current technology stack.
</p>
<p>
    An example that involves me are .Net rescue projects. A lot of times I get hired as a consultant for companies that have an existing .Net application that needs enhancements or bug fixes. For whatever reason, whoever created or started the project has left and the company needs someone to rescue their project. I call these rescue projects as I often come in and fix whatever problems were left over. Essentially rescuing the client from an unworkable solution and delivering a working product. Having a deep understanding and experience in C# makes me a qualified candiate for rescuing projects that were created in .Net and C#. There is usually very little ramp up time on my part and I'm able to report to the client what the issue is and deliver a fix. 
</p>
<p>
    Some other examples of relevant experience include:
    <ul>
        <li>Domain Expertise: Does the consultant have experience in your industry (e.g., healthcare, finance)?</li>
        <li>Project Types: Look for experience with similar projects, such as data migrations, cloud migrations, API development, or interactive data viz tools.</li>
        <li>Technology Stack: Check for familiarity with tools and technologies like C#, React, Azure, AWS, Docker, or CI/CD pipelines.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Review Their Portfolio</h2>
<p>
   What better way to see what a freelancer has done than to review their portfolio. Most freelancers have an online portfolio or a link they can send you if you inquire about what they've done in the past. Some consultants do not have public portfolios due to NDAs and other contract agreements that do not allow them to display their work publicly. 
</p>

<h2>Assess Their Communication and Soft Skills</h2>
<p>
    Communication is a big part of software development. Many people mistakenly think that all developers do is code, however communicating with the client and stakeholders is just as valuable as the coding aspect. It's important for developers to clearly understand the problem and solution before starting to build a solution. If the team is unclear on the work to be done they will end up wasting valuable hours and dollars. It's in everyones best interest to find that consultant who is a clear communicator and has the soft skills to compliment their technical abilities.
</p>
<p>
    Some questions to ask about communication when considering hiring a consultant for a project are:
    <ul>
        <li>Technical Communication: Can they explain complex concepts in simple terms for non-technical stakeholders?</li>
        <li>Collaboration: Are they open to feedback and able to work seamlessly with in-house teams?</li>
        <li>Problem-Solving Approach: Do they demonstrate a proactive approach to identifying and solving problems?</li>
    </ul>
</p>
