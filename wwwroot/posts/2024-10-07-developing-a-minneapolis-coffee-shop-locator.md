<p>Over the weekend I had the idea to create a Minneapolis coffee shop locator app. I'm going to call it <a href="https://mplscoffee.com" rel="noreferrer">MPLS Coffee</a>. The idea is simple, the user will open the app and it will show them the all the coffee shops in Minneapolis in a map view relative to where the user is located. There will also be a list screen that displays the coffee shops in order from nearest to farthest. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="/images/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-07-at-12.25.57-PM.png" class="kg-image" alt="" loading="lazy" width="930" height="420" srcset="/images/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-07-at-12.25.57-PM.png 600w, /images/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-07-at-12.25.57-PM.png 930w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Coffee shops in Minneapolis</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here is the reasons why I want to make this app:</p><ol><li>I want a single location to find the nearest coffee shop to me. Yelp and Google provide this feature, but not in a very user friendly way. I have to type, filter, page, move map, etc. It becomes too much. I want to create a stupid simple application that just gives me coffee shops close to me.</li><li>Yelp and Google will return lists of coffee shops all over town when I search them - not necessarily ones that are close. Even places that are not really coffee shops show up, restaurants that serve coffee for example. By creating my own app I can filter out what businesses are displayed. </li><li>Good Coffee filter. This is where the app is going to shine. I will manually curate a list of coffee shops that I called Good Coffee. These are shops that use good roasters (both local and national) that I would recommend to a friend. </li><li>Two toggles on the top of the screen for Open now and Good Coffee. No need to click back and forth from a settings screen. Again, stupid simple UI.</li></ol><p>I'll do my best to build in public, starting with this blog post. Here's how I'm planning to build this application.</p><p>At first I thought about gathering info on all the coffee shops and keep it in a basic JSON file for both the app and website. But Minneapolis has tons of coffee shops and updating them all manually would be a nightmare.</p><p>So, instead I decided to write my own harvester console app in C# to harvest data from Google via the Places API. It'll run once a week (month?) and keep everything fresh without me having to do any manual work - other than write the data harvester and API integration.</p><p>For the tech stack, I'm going with React Native for the app and .NET for the API and data harvester. Database-wise, I was considering PostgreSQL, but then I remembered I've already got a MySQL server up and running. Might as well use that for storing the coffee shop data. </p><p>In addition to all the data being provided by Google, I created a IsGoodCoffee bit field on the CoffeeShops database table. This is where I will manually check off the good coffee shops in town that I recommend.</p><p>This setup will keep my data up-to-date automatically. Plus, I plan to include a flag system to easily spot and remove any shops that close down or just don't make the cut. As I started to think about the project I realized that by only focusing on Minneapolis, we'd be missing out on all the great and new coffee shops in St. Paul. Therefore, MPLS Coffee will also include STP.</p><p>By automating most of the work, we'll have a constantly updated, accurate list of coffee shops in Minneapolis and Saint Paul. The goal being to be the go-to resource for people looking for good coffee in the Twin Cities.</p><p>It's going to be a lot of work, but I'm excited to see this project come to life. </p><p></p>
