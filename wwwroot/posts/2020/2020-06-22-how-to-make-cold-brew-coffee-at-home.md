<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>Here&#8217;s an easy guide on how to make cold brew coffee at home. Makin cold brew coffee at home is pretty simple &#8211; just grind your beans then soak them in big jars on the counter for about 16 hours.</p>
<p>I follow the <a href="https://www.stumptowncoffee.com/blog/cold-brewing-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stumptown method</a> of 12:64, that&#8217;s 12 ounces of freshly ground coffee to 64 ounces of water. This will create a strong concentrate of coffee, so I usually cut the finished product with 1:1 amount of water. You can soak your coffee grounds longer if you want to some really strong coffee concentrate.</p>
<h2><strong>Step 1.</strong></h2>
<p>Get some coffee, preferably a 12 oz bag of whole coffee beans. I like to use my local Minneapolis roaster, <a href="https://spyhousecoffee.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spyhouse Coffee</a>. You can use already ground if you like as well.</p>
<h2><strong>Step 2:</strong></h2>
<p>Grind those beans on the coarsest setting possible. Or dump out your bag of already ground beans into a bowl if that&#8217;s the route you&#8217;re taking.</p>
<h2><strong>Step 3:</strong></h2>
<p>Fill a 64 ounce jar/pitcher/container of your choosing with filtered water. Dump your coffee into the jar.</p>
<h2><strong>Step 4:</strong></h2>
<p>Stir the coffee and water together.</p>
<h2><strong>Step 5:</strong></h2>
<p>Seal the jar or cover the jar with a towel and let it sit out on the counter for the next 16 or so hours.</p>
<h2><strong>Step 6:</strong></h2>
<p>After 16 hours of room temperature &#8220;chilling&#8221; the coffee is done. Grab a mesh strainer or other type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sieve</a>, hold the strainer over another container/jar and pour the coffee through the strainer letting the liquid pour through into the second jar/container. This will catch the big chunks of coffee grounds.</p>
<h2><strong>Step 7: </strong></h2>
<p>Now we&#8217;re on to the final step. Rinse the junk out of the first jar/container and place a new coffee filter over it. Pour the first filtered coffee through the coffee filter into the original jar/container. This will filter out the rest of the sludge from the coffee.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s it. Store the finished product in the fridge and enjoy over ice. I like to cut the final result with a 1:1 ratio of water to coffee to dull it down a little bit. Pour the final result over ice and enjoy the summer. A splash of milk of any variety is a nice touch as well.</p>
