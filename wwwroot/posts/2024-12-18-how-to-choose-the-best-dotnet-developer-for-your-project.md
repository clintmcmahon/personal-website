    <p>
        When projects get to be larger than a one-person project, I tend to hire other freelance developers to come and work with me. After all these years, I've been able to create a core group of developers that I work with. However, due to the nature of consulting, those people are not always free when I need to bring them on the project. When that happens, I need to find the best developer I can find. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This can be really overwhelming. It's important to ask the right questions so you can make the right choice for whatever role you're hiring for—usually, in my case, it's freelance developers with experience in the tech stack that is being used—primarily <a href="/blog/im-a-c-sharp-consultant-for-hire">C#, .NET, and React</a>. It’s not an easy task, even for this technically inclined developer. Here are some of the things that I ask and look for when I'm looking for a new developer to bring onto a project.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Clearly Define the Problem You Want to Solve</h2>
    <p>
        Start by identifying the problem that you're trying to solve. When you can define the problem, you can start looking for people who have the skills and experience to solve said problem. For instance, what’s not working or what you wish was functioning better? Think critically about the type of service you need. For instance:
        <ul>
            <li>Does the solution require a website that drives traffic and sales?</li>
            <li>Should it be an e-commerce platform to sell products?</li>
            <li>Are you looking for app development, legacy system migration, or bug fixes?</li>
        </ul>
        Understanding the specific challenges and the solution you need ensures you’re hiring the right consultant for the job.
    </p>
    <p>
        Example Scenario: Your team is struggling to modernize a legacy system into a scalable cloud-based platform. A freelance consultant with a proven track record in Azure migrations and cloud architecture will be able to deliver immediate value, guiding you and the team through the process while minimizing ramp-up time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Key Advantage: Since most good freelancers are jack-of-all-trades, they specialize in delivering solutions, not learning curves.
    </p>

    <h2>Look for Relevant Experience</h2>
    <p>
        If you can find a freelancer with experience in your chosen <a href="/blog/tech-stacks-dont-really-matter">tech stack</a> (C#, React, SQL Server) or industry (healthcare, finance, legal, etc.), then you are in a good place. You will want to hire people who are not going to need a lot of hand-holding. In full-time hires, you've got more time to dedicate to learning, but when you are billing for time, you do not want to waste time explaining how a git merge works.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make sure that the consultant you are bringing on has at least some knowledge and understanding of the technology stack and industry. 
        <ul>
            <li>Domain Expertise: Does the consultant have experience in your industry (e.g., healthcare, finance)?</li>
            <li>Look for experience with similar projects, such as cloud migrations, API development, or interactive tools.</li>
            <li>Check for familiarity with tools and technologies like Azure, C# .NET, Docker, or CI/CD pipelines.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Review Their Portfolio</h2>
    <p>
        Ask the developer to provide some examples of their previous work that relate to the project you are working on. Ask them to submit their online portfolio or GitHub profile for you to look at. Sometimes consultants are not allowed to publicly display their work due to NDAs and other arrangements with previous clients. If that's the case, ask them specific questions about your problem to get a feel for how they would approach solving it or how they might design the system you are working on.  
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to visual examples, I always like to ask potential consultants to walk me through their latest project and tell me about their role. This gives me a good idea of what kind of working style they have in addition to their technical experience.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Assess Their Communication and Other Soft Skills</h2>
    <p>
        Consulting is not the same as being a full-time engineer. As a full-time engineer, you can sit in a corner and code for 90% of your time. In consulting and freelancing, a lot of time is spent talking with clients and interacting with people. Potential freelancers should have the ability to talk to users of all different levels and be comfortable doing so. In a project, you will be asked to explain complex concepts in simple terms for non-technical stakeholders while also being able to discuss those same topics from a development and implementation standpoint to the hardcore technical members on the team. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Freelancers come in as a solo developer, but they need to be a good collaborator to be effective. Make sure that the person you are looking to hire is open to feedback and able to work seamlessly with in-house teams. In-house teams can be existing development groups, marketing teams, or a solo founder. After all, they are the ones who are paying the bills, so you better be able to understand and work well with them.
    </p>

    <h2>Evaluate Their Technical Expertise</h2>
    <p>
        Good freelancers have a wide range of skills, but it’s essential to assess their technical depth. A good C# .NET consultant should not only have experience with the stack but also the ability to implement best practices and solve actual real-world problems. 
    </p>
    <p>
        One way to assess this is to provide a sample problem or scenario relevant to your project and evaluate how they approach it. It doesn't have to be an eight-hour take-home project—that would be ridiculous. For example, you could ask them how they would optimize a slow database query or design a scalable architecture for your application. Their ability to think critically and problem-solve will give you a good sense of their understanding of the technology involved.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider these factors:
        <ul>
            <li>Are they experienced using version control like Git?</li>
            <li>Can they integrate technologies like REST APIs or front-end frameworks like React?</li>
            <li>Do they have knowledge of optimization techniques for .NET applications?</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        By assessing their technical expertise upfront, you avoid mistakes and ensure the person coming in will be able to get things done.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Consider Availability and Flexibility</h2>
    <p>
        Freelancers often have multiple projects going on at the same time, so ensuring their availability aligns with your project timelines is critical. Before hiring, have an open discussion about their schedule, other commitments, and bandwidth. Ask how much time they can dedicate to your project and whether they can handle potential changes in scope. Be clear upfront with them about how much of their time you are expecting as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another important consideration is their flexibility. Projects don’t always go as planned, and having a consultant who can adapt to shifting priorities or unexpected challenges is key. For example, if your project expands to include additional features, can they pivot their approach to accommodate these changes without impacting other deliverables?
    </p>
    <p>
        Consider long-term support. Be mindful of who is going to take care of this project after it's built and published to the world. Will they be available for ongoing maintenance or updates after the project is complete? I like to have a maintenance contract or retainer in place for this sort of thing.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Compare Cost and Value</h2>
    <p>
        Budget is always a consideration when hiring a consultant, but it’s important to look beyond the hourly rate. A cheaper consultant might take longer to deliver or produce subpar results, while someone with higher rates could bring efficiency and quality that save you money in the long run.
    </p>
    <p>
        Focus on the value they bring to your project. For example, a consultant with a track record of building scalable, high-performing applications can save you money in maintenance and support down the line. It’s not just about cost; it’s about finding the right balance of quality and affordability. Usually, the higher-priced consultants are higher-priced for a reason.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Have a Contract</h2>
    <p>
        Once you’ve found the right consultant, formalize the agreement with a detailed contract. A clear, comprehensive contract not only protects both parties but also sets expectations for the project.
    </p>
    <p>
        Make sure the contract includes:
        <ul>
            <li>Deliverables: Clearly outline what the consultant will deliver and in what timeframe.</li>
            <li>Payment Terms: Specify payment schedules, rates, and any conditions for bonuses or penalties.</li>
            <li>Intellectual Property Rights: Ensure it’s clear who owns the code and other assets produced during the project.</li>
            <li>Termination Clause: Outline conditions for ending the contract early, whether due to performance issues or scope changes.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Choosing the right consultant isn't an easy or simple task. I've been burned in the past by hiring someone who I thought was great and ended up getting burned. But with the right approach, you can find a skilled developer who will deliver exceptional results. By putting in a little extra effort by defining your needs, evaluating their technical expertise, and ensuring strong communication and collaboration, you should be able to find the right consultant for your project.
