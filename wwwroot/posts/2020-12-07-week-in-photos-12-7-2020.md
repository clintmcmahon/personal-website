<!--kg-card-begin: html--><p>In an effort to get myself to write and take more photos I decided to start a weekly post of the previous week&#8217;s photos that I took. I don&#8217;t have much of a plan for this series, but it feels like a good way to get myself to reflect on the past week and focus on writing more. It&#8217;s December, so with the Holidays and another heavy quarantine around the corner what better way to document the season? So here goes.</p>

<p>The neighborhood squirrels started a war last week. I&#8217;ve looked the other way as they ate our Halloween pumpkins or taunted our dog on the front steps. But it all changed last week. Every week I get a bag of coffee sent to our house through the online subscription service, <a href="http://drinktrade.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trade</a>. Last week I was looking forward to this new bag from <a href="https://irvingfarm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Irving Farm</a> in New York. When I went outside to pick up the coffee beans much to my surprise the neighborhood squirrels busted into my the back and tore it apart. It&#8217;s on now, guys.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve reached that in-between time of year where it&#8217;s not the colorful part of fall or the pretty part of winter. We&#8217;re living in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhZULM69DIw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mama&#8217;s and the Papa&#8217;s song &#8211; California Dreamin</a></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-917 aligncenter" src="/images/wordpress/2020/12/8A0BC082-AEA4-4A4E-AD79-BF5EC18A09F7.jpeg" alt="Marshmellow Old Fashioned" width="640" height="640" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>We made <a href="https://vinepair.com/cocktail-recipe/marshmallow-old-fashioned-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marshmallow old fashions</a> and they are great.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-918 aligncenter" src="/images/wordpress/2020/12/DCADDA61-804F-4E9F-9EAE-D4A056BCEB6F.jpeg" alt="COVID Dishwasher" width="640" height="489" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>Since we have been quarantined it feels like we&#8217;re running the dishwasher every day of the week. And while the dishwasher is running, we&#8217;ve got a pile of dishes waiting in the sink for the next run. Much like a crowded rush hour platform, these dishes are always waiting for the next train/available washer.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-921 aligncenter" src="/images/wordpress/2020/12/IMG_1953.jpeg" alt="Bell's Christmas Ale" width="480" height="640" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the best time of year for beer. We picked up four six packs of Christmas ales last week. <a href="http://www.bellsbeer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two sets of Bell&#8217;s</a> &#8211; their Christmas Scotch Ale and their Old Fashioned holiday brew, <a href="https://www.sintbernardus.be/en/brewery/our-beers/stbernardus-christmas-ale-en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">St. Bernardas Christmas Ale</a> and <a href="https://www.odellbrewing.com/beer/isolation-ale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Odell&#8217;s Isolation Ale</a>.<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-922 aligncenter" src="/images/wordpress/2020/12/IMG_1971.jpeg" alt="Contrail" width="531" height="640" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px" /></p>
<p>And finally the last worthy photo I took last week. There&#8217;s nothing special to say about this one, other than I really liked the way it all came together.</p>
