<p>This blog post outlines how to migrate a WordPress website from any hosting provider to WP Engine hosting account without access to source FTP site. The post focuses around utilizing the WP Engine Migration Assistant Plugin. WP Engine offers a specialized plug in to make WordPress migrations a pretty simple from one hosting provider to another. In this example it doesn&#8217;t matter what your hosting provider is, this plug in should work with any of them. And best of all, you don&#8217;t need access to the source FTP site to do the migration.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Managed Hosting for Business Operations</h2>

<p>A large part of my business is providing an array of WordPress hosting services that cover all the backend configurations, including SSL installations, plugin updates, and server-side optimizations for my clients&#8217; websites. This frees them up to focus on their business and what they do best instead of having to struggle working on a system they dont&#8217; understand nor do they care about understanding it. Part of my service offering is migrating WordPress sites from their old hosting provider to my own managed WP Engine hosting service.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prerequisites</h2>
