<p>I just read a <a href="https://www.consultingsuccess.com/tech-to-consulting" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.consultingsuccess.com/tech-to-consulting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> about tech folks leaving their full time jobs for the world of consulting. I&#8217;ve been in this demographic for seven years now. Part of this article was how to position yourself as a consultant and to stand out. Specifically, what&#8217;s your Laser-Focused Positioning Statement? Meaning, how are you specifically positioning yourself in the market? I&#8217;ve never thought much about how to position <a href="https://clintmcmahon.com/benefits-of-being-a-software-consultant/" data-type="post" data-id="21171">myself as a consultant</a>. Mostly, I&#8217;ve just put it out there that I develop websites and mobile apps for startups and small businesses. This has done pretty well for me over the years, but when I think about my ideal client there are some clients that come to mind that are not ideal. Maybe this comes down to how I position myself. Having positioned myself as a generalist or maybe not positioned myself at all &#8211; has led to clients &amp; work that is not my ideal. I&#8217;ve always thought anyone who wants a website, mobile app or is in need of technology strategy is my ideal client. Perhaps that&#8217;s not the case.</p>

<p>Back to my laser-focused positioning statement. My positioning in the past as been:</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>I&#8217;m a web &amp; mobile app developer. That&#8217;s not very laser focused at all. It&#8217;s extremely generic. Based on this very generic position, I started to write my new laser focused position statement. Starting with &#8220;I&#8217;m the founder of msoftware, we&#8217;re technology consultants who help startups, small businesses and researchers with their technology strategy, data visualizations &amp; web and mobile app development. Unlike my competitors, we are focused on how we can help solve your problems instead of just selling software you may not even need</p>
<cite>&#8211; Me</cite></blockquote>

<p>That&#8217;s a lot and feels awkward when reading it all together, but like the article points out &#8211; it&#8217;s still pretty generic. The laser-focused positioning statement should be specific to an ideal who, what and why. I love working on <a href="https://report.srtr.org/opo/mnop" data-type="URL" data-id="https://report.srtr.org/opo/mnop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interesting data visualizations projects</a>. There is something about seeing raw data in nothing but rows &amp; columns, something that can be overwhelming to the naked eye. Taking that dataset and moving it into a beautiful data visualization backed with a structured data set that can be consumed &amp; understood with little previous understand of the data. Some of my favorite clients &amp; projects have been for companies who have large datasets but don&#8217;t have the people, skills, resources or what-not to take this data and organize it into a consumable format. That format being a website or nicely displayed out mobile format. I love walking into a project when the team says &#8211; &#8220;here is our data, what can you do with it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Therefore, my updated laser-focused positioning statement is &#8220;I&#8217;m a technology consultant who works with starts up and data intensive businesses to help process and game value from their information &amp; data. Unlike my competition, I work one-on-one to understand the business &amp; the needs of the business before designing a technology strategy.&#8221; This means I don&#8217;t come in excepting to build or code anything. I just listen to the customer pain points. Sometimes there isn&#8217;t a need to development anything all all. Perhaps off the shelf software will do the trick or maybe they just need to reconfigure something. Essentially, my new elevator pitch is &#8211; I help companies define what they need &amp; where they want to be. Then I help them get there. Sometimes with code and sometimes without.</p>
