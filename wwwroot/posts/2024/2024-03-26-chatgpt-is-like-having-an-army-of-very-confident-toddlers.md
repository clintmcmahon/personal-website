<p>A friend said this to me the other day. I find it funny because a lot of the time when I use ChatGPT I do feel like it's a very confident toddler. Not that it's responses are uneducated, but no matter what the response to my question or task ChatGPT is very confident that it is correct. Even when I point out that the answer is incorrect, the AI system is confident that it was wrong and apologizes to me for the error. </p><p>Here are some of the things that are similar between the toddlers and ChatGPT:</p><ul><li>Without proper guidance they don't end up being as helpful as they think are. </li><li>No matter what question I ask or even what their answer is, they are confident their answer is the right one. Even when acknowledging they were wrong.</li><li>Sometimes it gets stuck on a single point that isn't necessary and will not let it go without an explicit ask.</li><li>Every question you ask teaches them something new.</li><li>If they're not properly guided they can spin off into their own world.</li></ul><p>Much like toddlers, it's important to guide ChatGPT and other AI systems to come up with solutions that are helpful and accurate.<br></p>
