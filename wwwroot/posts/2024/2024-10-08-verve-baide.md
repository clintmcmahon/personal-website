**Verve** · Honduras · ★★★★☆

**Grind:** #4-5 espresso · #20 pour over · **Water:** 205°F

Really good coffee and easy to brew in the Chemex. It was a light roast and a single origin. It tasted more dark than a light roast. I bet if I eased up on the grind setting a little bit I would taste more of the flavors of the light roast.
