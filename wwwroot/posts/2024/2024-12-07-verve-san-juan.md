**Verve Coffee** · Peru · Light Roast · ★★★☆☆

<!-- IMAGE: san-juan.png -->

**Grind:** #4 espresso · #18-19 pour over (22g dose) · **Water:** 205°F

Single origin. A sweet morning treat. Roast level 2-4.

Peach, lemonbar & fudge. I like this coffee a lot. Katie loves it. Normally would dismiss this as too lemon but it's a total banger.

Can really taste the fudge. A dark chocolaty taste makes for my type of bold coffee for winter.

Three stars, but honestly could have been four. The fudge notes were exactly what I wanted for cold December mornings.
