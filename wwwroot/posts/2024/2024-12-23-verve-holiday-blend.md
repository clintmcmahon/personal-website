**Verve** · ★★★★☆

**Grind:** #5 espresso · #20ish pour over · **Water:** 205°F

Primarily drank this as an espresso drink. Makes for really great egg nog latte. Grind size fine but consistent.

Makes for a strong/bold pour over and pours fast. Could pour slower or grind finer.

Four stars. Holiday blends can be gimmicky, but this one delivered. Perfect for seasonal lattes.
