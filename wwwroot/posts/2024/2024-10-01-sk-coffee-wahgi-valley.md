**S.K. Coffee** · Papua New Guinea · ★★★☆☆

**Grind:** #2 espresso · #18-19 pour over · **Water:** 205°F

My first bag from S.K. Coffee. A Papua New Guinea isn't an origin that I remember bring very much of, but that's another point of this journal - remember what I'm brewing. Solid three-star territory that was pretty good. I'm not sure this type of roast is in my wheelhouse but I will need to adjust my brew settings to get more notes out of this one.
