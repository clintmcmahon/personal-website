My first coffee journal entry. An Indian single origin from Verve. I don't normally brew coffees from this region, but that's kind of the point of a subscription isn't it? You get to try coffees from different places, hopefully some places you never would have thought to get coffee from. No detailed tasting notes on this one, just getting the system started.
