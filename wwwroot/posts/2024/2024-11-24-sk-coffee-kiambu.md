**S.K. Coffee** · Kenya · ★★★★★

**Grind:** #2 espresso · #20 pour over · **Water:** 205°F

Happy Thanksgiving!

Absolute banger. A real powerhouse coffee. It's good for espresso but a better coffee for pour overs. Felt a bit on the sour side for pour over. Might be because I've been doing two espresso grind size. 

The #2 on espresso is misleading for this entry. Sometime in 2025 I recalibrated my Breville machine. If I did this coffee again the grind setting would be much higher.
