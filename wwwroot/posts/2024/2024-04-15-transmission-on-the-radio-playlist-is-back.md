<p>I created a script that runs every Thursday night at 11pm central time to automatically update a Spotify playlist called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2OBe5huAfypRUl1zW6md2A?si=3fb48caa2b2841ae&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=5ef70ea86604424e" rel="noreferrer">Transmission On The Radio</a>. Transmission is a weekly dance party hosted by DJ Jake Rudh in Minneapolis every Wednesday. On Thursday nights he plays his set list from the night before <a href="https://www.thecurrent.org/profile/jake-rudh" rel="noreferrer">on 89.3 The Current</a>. The Current is our local non profit/commercial free radio station. </p><p>For the past year or two the system wasn't operation, but driving home from swimming lessons I realized I had an extra thirty minutes this morning, so I sat down at the keyboard to get the playlist back up and running.</p><p>Going to Transmission was one of my favorite things to do. DJ Jake Rudh and the Current have done an amazing job with this show and it's got to be one of the best shows on any radio station in the country. Since having a kid I'm not getting out on Wednesday nights for the live show as much as I used to and I'm generally asleep by 10PM on Thursdays when the radio show airs. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="352" title="Spotify Embed: Transmission On The Radio" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2OBe5huAfypRUl1zW6md2A?si=3fb48caa2b2841ae&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=5ef70ea86604424e&amp;utm_source=oembed"></iframe></figure><p>Seeing the problem right in front of me I did what any good engineer does: I coded a task to automate the radio set for me so I can listen to the show the next day. The playlist is updated every Thursday night at 11:01PM.
