This is where it all started. One bag, one notebook, one attempt to actually pay attention to what I was drinking.

## Kerehaklu
**Verve** · India · ★★★☆☆

*September 17, 2024*

| Brew Method | Grind Setting |
|-------------|---------------|
| Espresso | #3 |
| Pour Over | #23 |

My first official journal entry. An Indian single origin from Verve—not a region I typically reach for, but that's kind of the point of a subscription. No detailed tasting notes on this one, just getting the system started.

Three stars feels right for a solid, unremarkable cup. Nothing wrong with it, nothing that made me sit up and take notice. A fine way to begin.

**Next up:** [October 2024](/blog/coffee-journal-october-2024) brings Papua New Guinea, Honduras, and my first battle with Ethiopian beans.
