January 2026 was a hard month for Minneapolis. I spent the month documenting the city going through the ICE surge. By doing that I hope I was able to show just how the people in the city feel about what is happening at this point in time. Along the way, I was able to take a couple photos that didn't involve people telling ICE to leave the city. January was a tough month for photography. Taking photos for fun while the city is occupied and people are afraid to leave their house just doesn't feel as good to me. There were bright spots for sure. I've never seen the city come together like we have in January 2026.
