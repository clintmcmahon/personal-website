The night after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Alex_Pretti">Alex Pretti</a> was killed by two ICE agents in Minneapolis, the city came together to honor his memory. With little advance organization, memorials appeared on street corners all over town. Larger gatherings at major intersections, but also small, quiet vigils on the neighborhood corners. On the walk to a larger vigil we passed three or four smaller ones. People came out in the cold to cry, sing and be close to their neighbors.
