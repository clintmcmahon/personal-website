Despite the temperature being -8F with a -23 degrees windchill factor, 50K Minnesotans showed up on in the January cold in downtown Minneapolis for an anti-ICE march. The event was part of the greater <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Minnesota_general_strike">Minnesota general strike</a> that brought together the people of Minnesota to protest immigration enforcement policies that have been going on in Minneapolis. The march started in The Commons by the Vikings stadium and wound through the streets of downtown over to Target Center. Despite just how cold it was, everyone was upbeat and determined. These photos capture the faces, the signs, and the solidarity of a community that refuses to stay silent.
